### STEEL by Exo Product Brainstorming
**or Steel for short**
- *Still needs refinement*
# Steel App
*The app needs to be able to connect all the moving parts somehow* It will house the Steel Card digital.

# **Steel by Exo: Executive Summary** -- Subject to change

## 🎯 **What We're Building**
**Steel is a premium identity and access ecosystem that bridges digital identity with real-world experiences through secure NFC technology.**

---

## 🏗️ **The Core Components**

### **1. Digital-First Membership Platform**
- **Application-based exclusivity** (Select-style vetting)
- **Virtual Steel Card** in mobile app (iOS/Android)
- **Access dashboard** for partner benefits, events, and connections
- **Starting point:** Digital-only membership before any hardware

### **2. Physical Access Tokens (Progressive Rollout)**
- **Phase 1:** NFC-embedded metal cards (no visible data)
- **Phase 2:** Wearable bracelets (silicon/metal/fabric options)
- **Both feature:** Encrypted dynamic tokens, not static card numbers

### **3. Steel Security Protocol**
- **Zero static data** on physical tokens
- **Dynamic cryptographic handshake** per transaction
- **Phone-paired biometrics** (Face ID/Touch ID as 2FA)
- **Remote disable capability** for lost tokens

### **4. Exclusive Partner Network**
- **Curated, not open** partner selection
- **Hospitality focus:** Boutique hotels, restaurants, clubs
- **Experience focus:** Events, travel, luxury retail
- **Partners pay for access** to verified high-value members

### **5. Social & Networking Layer**
- **Tap-to-connect** professional networking (ICP) as well as (youth) - Steel is the modern identity layer for high-performers at first.
- **Privacy-gradient sharing** (control what info gets shared)
- **Guest pass system** for non-members to receive basic info
- **3-second connection rule** (faster than Apple's NameDrop)

### **6. Payment Infrastructure**
- **Closed-loop system** (gift card regulations, not banking)
- **Seamless payments** via linked payment methods
- **Partner terminals** that authenticate only (no payment data)
- **"Magic behind the scenes" UX** - payment happens automatically

### **7. Community & Innovation**
- **The Foundry:** Member-driven R&D sandbox - really for new ideas I guess also (e.g. Episodic, interactive film platform [where clients can interact with the actual cinema we produce via Exo Launch or other route] hosted within 'The Foundry'); as well as other in person events can take place, might be a reach at the moment but it is worth the brainstorm.
- **Exclusive events** and experiences
- **Beta access** to new features
- **Integration with Exo's** AI and business tools

---

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **For Members:**
1. Apply → Get approved → Digital access immediately
2. Optional: Order physical card/bracelet ($495/year tier) [have not come up with real pricing structure yet, compared it to Amex yearly card... need thought, seems i'm still in idea land]
3. Tap token at partner → "Welcome [Name]" appears → Payment processes automatically
4. Tap token to another phone → Share contact/social info (with privacy controls)
5. Access exclusive events, hotel rates, and partner perks

### **For Partners:**
1. Get Steel terminal (app or hardware)
2. Member taps → Authentication → Payment routed
3. Receive transaction + member analytics (anonymized)
4. Access to verified high-spending customer base

### **Technical Flow:**
```
Member Taps Token → Encrypted Token → Steel Backend → 
→ Authenticates → Maps to Payment Method → Processes Payment →
→ Confirmation to Terminal → Receipt to App
```

This detailed specification provides everything a supplier needs to understand the vision, technical requirements, and production needs for both physical products. -- *THESE ARE STILL IN BRAINSTORM MODE, AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AS WELL AS CORE PRODUCT(S).*


## Question Requirements + Delete Parts/Process (LLM Thought Experiments)

Based on the detailed specs, here are the critical questions and recommended deletions to simplify, de-risk, and focus on a viable MVP:

🚨 Critical Questions (Assumptions to Pressure-Test)
1. Technical Feasibility & Cost
Q: Can we achieve "dynamic token generation" with a passive NFC chip (NTAG 424) without a battery? Most secure dynamic tokens require active power. This might be the single biggest technical hurdle.

Q: What is the real read reliability of NFC through metal? Stainless steel significantly dampens NFC signals. The card may require a plastic window or different material.
*Add On by User:* Does not have to be literal Steel at first; we can have other variations to start and have Steel once product is mastered. Or keep Steel Card as the aspirational product.

Q: Are the cost targets realistic? $25/unit for a metal-embedded NFC card units is aggressive. $45 for a modular, water-resistant bracelet core is likely impossible at that volume... correct me if I'm wrong.

Q: Does the "3-second connection" for social sharing work if the recipient doesn't have the Steel app? The fallback web experience could break the promise.

2. User Behavior & Desirability
Q: Will users carry a metal card if they're already used to phone payments? The card must offer undeniable utility beyond a phone.
*Add On by User:* Access + Utility comes with Steel ecosystem. Payment features are the add-on.

Q: Is the bracelet a status symbol or a liability? A visible wearable for access/payment might raise security and privacy concerns in public.
*Add On by User:* Good point, "Steel Security" must keep this in mind. 

Q: For the premium tiers, is the value in the hardware or the access? The $495/$995 pricing must be justified by network benefits, not just object quality.
*Add On by User:* These pricing models were made by another LLM so they are no where near finished or concreate.

3. Business Model Viability
Q: Can we onboard partners with a 1-3% fee when they already pay ~2.6% to credit cards? Our fee must be lower and we must drive higher-value transactions.
*Add On by User:* Good point, the money model must be thought through. Also, the U.S.P. must be thought through as well; are tehy paying for security or high-value clients or something else.

Q: Will members pre-load a closed-loop system with significant funds? This is a major behavioral hurdle vs. direct card linking.
Direct card linking was always the thought process, loading or reloading the card can be thought through as well.

Q: Does the "partner subscription for data" model conflict with our promise of member privacy?
This can be thought through as well, seems there is another way to monitize the data without sharing, or we can use it internally for ourselves via insights for products we will sell in the future.

4. Manufacturing & Complexity
Q: Does a modular bracelet system overcomplicate launch? Multiple SKUs (cores + 4 band types) create inventory, quality control, and support nightmares.
*Add On by User:* Starting small is the move, likely two options. Sport/Jewlerly [margin, can sell brand] or Fashion

Q: Can we secure one supplier for both card and bracelet? These are different manufacturing disciplines (metal card vs. wearable electronics).

✂️ What to Delete or Defer (LLM Recommendations)
DELETE ENTIRELY for MVP (Phase 1-2):
The Bracelet (Phase 2 → Phase 3+):

Why: It's a second, radically more complex hardware product with significant R&D, certification, and supply chain challenges. It dilutes focus from the core card experience.

Action: Make the bracelet a Year 2 roadmap item. Launch solely with the card. This cuts manufacturing complexity by >60%.

Interchangeable Band System:

Why: A "band ecosystem" is a startup trap. It's a fashion business, not a tech business, at this stage.

Action: If a bracelet happens later, launch with one band type (Sport Silicone). Add others only after proven demand.

"Guest Pass" System for Non-Members:

Why: Overcomplicates the social sharing flow. The goal is to grow the member network, not create a parallel non-member system.

Action: Sharing should be member-to-member only initially. Simpler.

Separate "Digital Only" ($199) and "Physical" ($495) Tiers:

Why: Creates a two-class system within the community and complicates marketing. The physical token is the magic.

Action: Have one membership tier that includes the digital platform. The physical card is a one-time purchase (e.g., $150-$250) or a clear, included perk of an "Elite" tier. Avoid fragmenting the network.

DEFER to Phase 2 or Later:
The Social "Tap-to-Connect" Layer:

Why: It's a secondary feature that depends on network density. The primary MVP job is Access & Payment.

Action: Launch social features after achieving critical mass in 1-2 cities. Don't build for a network that doesn't exist yet.
*Add On by User:* social feature (tap-to-share) are core to the product itself. Must be thought through not discarded. Payment feature is secondary if any.

"The Foundry" (Member R&D Sandbox):

Why: It's a visionary community feature with no immediate ROI. It can be built after proving the core model.

Action: Keep as a vision slide, but build the core partner network first.

API/Developer Platform:

Why: Premature. Need to solidify the core user experience and security model before opening it up.

Action: Mark as Year 2 Objective.

SIMPLIFY Radically:
Payment Infrastructure:

Problem: "Closed-loop system (gift card regulations)" is a regulatory and UX minefield (pre-loading, limits, abandonment).

Simplification: Use a card-linking model like Apple Pay. Partner terminal authenticates via Steel, but the payment is routed via a user's linked Visa/Mastercard through a payment processor (Stripe/Braintree). This is faster to market, more familiar to users, and avoids being a "money transmitter." You can still take a lower transaction fee.
*Add On by User:* "Orchestration Layer" is what we are going for, for security and payment. This simplified version seems well but has it's cons as well. Needs to be thought through.

Steel Security Protocol:

Problem: "Dynamic cryptographic handshake per transaction" with a passive card may not be feasible.

Simplification: Use a secure, static token on the card that is immediately invalidated if the card is reported lost via the app. This is still far more secure than a printed credit card number. Phone pairing can be for loss protection, not per-transaction 2FA.

Partner Terminal Hardware:

Problem: Asking partners to install new hardware is a massive barrier.

Simplification: Partner-facing iOS/Android App as the terminal. Employees use a company phone/tablet to tap member cards. Zero hardware cost for partners. Roll out dedicated hardware only for top-volume partners later.

🎯 Revised, Focused MVP Core
Phase 1 (Months 1-6):

Product: Digital Membership + One Physical Product (Steel Card).

Core Utility: Access & Authentication at curated partner venues.

Payment: Seamless, card-linked payments processed through partner's existing POS via an app or simple API—no closed-loop.

Social: Basic contact sharing via tap (member-to-member only).

Partners: 30 key venues in one launch city (not three). Use an app as the terminal.

Phase 2 (Months 7-12):

Expand member and partner network to 2 more cities.

Introduce enhanced social features and guest passes now that network exists.

Begin R&D on wearable bracelet as a future luxury SKU.

Result: You cut your initial hardware complexity by 50%, regulatory risk by 90%, partner onboarding friction by 70%, and focus all energy on proving the core hypothesis: People will carry a premium token for privileged access and seamless experience.

The mantra for a complex hardware/software/network product: Do one thing exceptionally well, then expand. For Steel, that one thing is being the most seamless key to exclusive places and people.

Your thoughts? We can bounce minds back and fourth.

*I have also beent thinking about having NFC powered collectables -- e.g. ecommerce stuff that seems cool for the brand that comes with NFC inside the product, once tapped these now become interact products. (Steel ashtray or Steel branded modern coffee cup with NFC interactivness) This can and most likely will cascade into other things like partners or events like a muesum with our branded NFC tags to explain a piece of art. Even though that seems far-out and would need major phasing, it seems cool to add and my have connections I cant/aren't putting together right now. Like a flywheel I cant see or something. I have alot of ideas.*

Needs more thought and branding definitions but logo is ready and idea phase is moving into more real areas than before.
